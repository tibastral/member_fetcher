Member fetcher is a simple tool used to automate the fetching of a member in a controller class.

You can now turn any class looking like that

  class PagesController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :fetch_page

    private
    def fetch_page
      if params[:id]
        @page ||= Page.find(params[:id])
      end
    end

    public
    def show
      #you can use here the @page instance variable
    end
  end


to that, which is much cleaner :

  class PagesController < ActionController::Base
    def show
      #you can use here the @page instance variable
    end
  end
